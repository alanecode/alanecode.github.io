- Who I am
- Interest in scientific models and how they can be used to learn things. 
- Simulation as a form of experiment is extremely interesting in relation to how we can use computers to learn about the physical world we find ourselves in.
- I am designing such an experiment to help explain patterns in the abundance of different plant species over time inferred from fossilised pollen sequences. 

I am interested in how [scientific
models](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/) can be used to
develop new useful understanding about the world. In particular, at a time when we are trying to understand complexity [Hawking quote] in fields such as molecular biology and the social sciences, one particuar manifestation of scientific models -- computer simulations -- are becoming increasingly important. I'm currently working on using the [Repast](https://repast.github.io) framework, written in the [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138747.html) language, to represent such models.

Complexity is driving the need for models to make the most of modern computing respurces. Consequently writing computer programs which serve as a manifestation of scientific models is an active and growing area of research interest in many fields. 

## Interests
### Scientific
- The role played by models in scientific practice [in
  general](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/], and the use of
  computer simulations as a form of experiment [in
  particular](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/simulations-science/).
- Data-driven approaches to model design and analysis.
- [Complexity science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/]) and
  its application to understanding the interactions and feedbacks both between
  humans, and with our biophysical environment.

### Technological
- Programming in Python (by preference), R (when it supports the best tool for the job), Javascript (for flashy graphics), and Java (with a begrudging respect).
- Interactive data visualisation
- Approaching low-cost hardware with a DIY mindset; think
  [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc), [Raspberry
  Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and making the most of old laptops through
  software choice and the dedication of tinker-time
- Free ([as in freedom](http://www.fsf.org)) software

### Analogue (away from screen)
- Reading fiction; abundant sci-fi and fantasy for escapism, and the odd
  philosophical novel as the result of finding myself in a book shop in a
  brooding mood.
- Making beer
- Cooking
- Hiking -- the English Lake District is the best for my money but I've
  recently been forced to admit North Wales has its charms too.
- British comedy -- Iannucci, Morris and their sardonic ilk.
