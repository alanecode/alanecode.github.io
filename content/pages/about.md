- Who I am
- Interest in scientific models and how they can be used to learn things. 

I am interested in how [scientific
models](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/) can be used to
develop new useful understanding about the world. In particular, at a time when we are trying to understand complexity [Hawking quote] in fields such as molecular biology and the social sciences, one particuar manifestation of scientific models -- computer simulations -- are becoming increasingly important. I'm currently working on using the [Repast](https://repast.github.io) framework, written in the [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138747.html) language, to represent such models.

Complexity is driving the need for models to make the most of modern computing respurces. Consequently writing computer programs which serve as a manifestation of scientific models is an active and growing area of research interest in many fields.
