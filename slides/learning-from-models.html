			### Why do scientists build models?

			- Prediction

			- Communication

			- Explain observations

			- Motivate experimental design

			Note:

			prediction: risk, planning (weather), obvious
			applications in economics

			communication: maps, photographs, schematics

			### Why do scientists build models?

			- Prediction

			- Communication

			- **Explain observations**

			- **Motivate experimental design**

			Note:

			I'm going to focus on the bottom two because I think
			they highlight an interesting point about how the use
			of models varies between theoretical physics and in the
			earth sciences

			---

			### Explain observations

			<img src="../images/solar-system.jpg"
			     alt="Solar system"
			     width="120%">

			Note:

			explaining existing data is a fundamental application
			of science. Our explanation of why we go through a
			cycle of light and dark once a day involves model of
			earth turning on its axis.


			Model of solar system explaining day and night

			Complexity means we can't use mathematical analysis to
			derive insights from first principles.

			---

			### Motivate experimental design

			       width="60%"/>

			  <img class="image2"
			       src="../images/cern-bike.jpg"
			       alt="Photo of a man riding a bike around CERN"
			       width="60%"/>
			</div>

			### Motivate experimental design

			<img src="../images/higgs-field.jpg"
			     alt="Schematic of Higgs potential">

			Note:

			Reactions are complicated but not complex.

			Yes lots of background theory goes into understanding
			how particles couple to the potential etc, but part of
			the reason for it being a useful theory was that it was
			easy to understand and made a measurable prediction:
			the mass of the boson responsible for coupling the
			higgs field to matter.

			- Difficult to write simple analytical expressions
			describing complex systems because of interacting
			terms.

			- E.g. Bololoubov transformation

			It is mysterious how QM always seems to have an answer
			for things like this. Makes me think it's a distraction
			orchestrated by the aliens running our simulation to
			stop us getting to the bottom of everything.

			An electrical current is an uncountable number of
			identical particles interacting with an electromagnetic
			field. Effects of interactions with each other and the
			other particales in conductors are negligible.

			The fact that mathematics has proved so useful in
			solving problems in physics since the 17th century is
			extrorinary, but it can become unwieldy as we start
			trying to represent complex systems (end up getting
			lots of terms)

			Typical physical system (think of a test particle in a
			field). Lunatics like Joe Basheen, Davide and Jason
			find ways of working on problems in many-body quantum
			mechanics

			---

			### First principles

			__Tobler's First law of Geography__

			"everything is related to everything else, but near
			things are more related than distant things."

			Note:
			- lack of reference to quantity
			- COMPLEXITY HAS PRECLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF THEORY

			### First principles

			__Tobler's First law of Geography__

			"everything is related to everything else, but near
			things are more related than distant things."
			

			----


			__First law of thermodynamics__

			$\Delta U = Q - W $

			---

			### Process and pattern

			Often in Earth science we have observe __patterns__ but
			don't have a clear understanding of the underlying
			__process__

			### Process and pattern

			<img src="../images/navarres_pollen.jpg"
			     alt="Example pollen diagram"
			     width="50%">

			(Carrion et al. 2010)


			---

			### Direct experimentation precluded by expense
			- Kevin Watt's WrEN project (natural experiment)
			- Harvard forest (one particular ecosystem, not repeatable)

			---

			### Generative modelling

			--

			### Pattern Orientated Modelling

			<img src="../images/perry2016-POM.jpg"
			     alt="Example pollen diagram"
			     width="50%">

			(Perry et al. 2016)

			### CMB vs pollen data comparison

			---

			### Observation leading theory
			- Pidgeon shit in the antenna
			- Gave weight to hypothesis (twice! -- importance of
			paying attention to data).

			---

			
			### Theory leading experiment
			- CERN
			- Compare cost of cern (considering motivating theory) and
			no. Experiments they'll do there with back of envelope
			calculation of cost of doing a live experiment using
			wildfire (land burned, no. people to evacuate)

			### Discriminative vs Generative modelling
			- Perry2016
			- Contrast discriminative model in rare events to
			Peterson2002.
